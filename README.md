Analyzing Effects of Time on Human Accuracy to differentiate CGI vs Photographic Portraits



The last decade has seen the most remarkable
growth in the field of computer-generated imagery. These
advances made it easier to create CGI(Computer Generated
Imagery) images that highly resemble photographic images.
However, despite these advances, the human observer’s ability to
differentiate the CGI and Photographic images is good. However,
we propose that time can affect the accuracy of humans. In
this paper, we describe an experiment to validate this claim and
analyze the effects of time on human accuracy to differentiate
CGI and photographic images. We find that with more time
provided to analyze the image, the accuracy of the human
participant to differentiate the CGI and photographic image
increases.
